In this step, we adjust the final result from [the previous tutorial](https://blog.px.dev/tables-are-hard-2) to prepare for streaming data.

How this was created:

* Clean up the styles to simplify them and prepare for future steps
* Change `useData.js` to emit log-like data, and prepare it to emit a stream of data
